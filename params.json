{"name":"Proxy mobile IPv6 model for OMNeT++","tagline":"","body":"### About the project\r\nThe OMNeT++ network simulator is used to develop and evaluate the proxy mobile IP (PMIP), called PMIPSim, which is an OMNeT++-based simulation model. OMNeT++ is a discrete event and open-source network simulator for the development of models such as queuing systems, communication networks, and multiprocessors, is free to use for academic purposes under the Academic Public License.  \r\nThe OMNet++ network simulator ‎and PMIPSim simulation model are used for evaluation of the PMIP as well as mobility solutions based on PMIP. PMIPSim is developed according to the IETF’s PMIP specifications and has been built based on the INET model, version 20090325. Furthermore, PMIPSim simulation model will be validated against a real-life PMIP testbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\nOmnetpp/pmip/examples.\r\n\r\n### Future work\r\nPMIPSim simulation model will be validated against a real-life PMIP testbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMuhana Muslam (muhana2@gmail.com), Prof. H Anthony Chan (h.anthony.chan@gmail.com), and Linda Xie ()\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nUnder construction\r\n","google":"UA-71846786-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
